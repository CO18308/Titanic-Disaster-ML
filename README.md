# Titanic-Disaster-ML
An online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners called Kaggle offers many machine learning development challenges throughout the year.
One among them is Titanic:machine learning from disaster challenge. One has to develop a machine learning approach to predict the survivors of the titanic disaster as accurately.
Project is a GUI based approach that implements the challenge in python with the help of linear regression.
Project makes use of Django- a web development framwork of python to provide one page web GUI to explore the implementation results.
Visualization of results are provided with help of matplotlib module of python.
Implementation provided in this project reaches an average accuracy of 80%.
